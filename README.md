Simple Soccer (GVSU AI 365)

Final project for GVSU AI course.  This was done as a pair with Brian Ledworth.

The goal of the project was to improve a soccer team AI in C++ from the book Programming Game AI By Example.
Each group in the class improved the same base code, with the improved teams being used in a tournament.
Our team won, and was only scored on once the entire tournament.

Our strategy was to create a hyper aggressive team.  
All players except for one constantly chased the ball to try to shoot it.
The remaining player was used for defense, constantly putting itself between the ball and goal.
The goalie code was left alone.
